<h2>Welcome to the AV Research repository where functionality comes first</h2>

Create and deploy a fully accessible Node/Express media application using two pieces of
multimedia (1 audio file, 1 video file).
Research best practices for audio, video, and special needs. What is the best option for each? What considerations should you make for delivery and implementation? What are the technical
requirements?

<br> The goal is to understand the requirements and find or create solutions that address or meet those requirements. Use routing with Node and Express to separate your audio and video presentations / pages.
Use one route for video, and render the appropriate assets.

<br> For standard features to be developed and included, based on the
resources Iâ€™m supplying (and your other research). As an example - size, visual contrast,tabbing, Aria attributes, screen readers, closed captioning, transcripts etc are all expected to be implemented (or a reasonable combination of these features). 



<h2>Accessibility Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Closed Captions: Closed captions are essential for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. They provide a text-based representation of the audio content of a video, enabling users to understand the content even if they cannot hear the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Indicators: Provide visual indicators for events such as starting and stopping a video, as well as any other important audio cues.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcripts: Providing transcripts of audio content is useful for users who prefer to read the content instead of listening to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all video and audio controls can be easily navigated with a keyboard, as some users may have difficulty using a mouse or other pointing device.</p></li>
<li><p>High Contrast: Use high contrast color schemes for the video and audio player, as well as any associated captions, to make it easier for users with low vision to distinguish them.</p></li>

</ul>
